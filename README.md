## Project Objectives

The challenge sets 4 objectives:

1) Create meaningful graphs, simulating a result dashboard according to the analyzed data from different sources.

2) Identify clients' unique profiles.

3) According to the clients' profiles identified earlier, choose the top 3 profiles in order for the company to create an action plan, focused on increasing monthly revenue.
Explain the motives for choosing them. Show how this action plan would be structured, including a logical step-by-step and the expected results.

4) Provide opinions on the company's website layout. What insights can I offer?
